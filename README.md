# Search Functionality README

## Overview
The Search Functionality allows users to efficiently find products, services, or accommodations (e.g., flights, hotels, car rentals) based on specific criteria such as dates, location, budget, amenities, and preferences. This functionality is a key feature of the application, providing users with an easy-to-navigate interface and a seamless experience when searching for offerings.

## Features
- **Search by Criteria**: Users can search for flights, hotels, or car rentals based on various criteria, including:
  - **Location** (City, Airport, Hotel Name)
  - **Date** (Departure Date, Check-in Date, Check-out Date)
  - **Budget** (Price Range, Class, Star Rating)
  - **Guest Preferences** (Non-smoking, Family-friendly, Pet-friendly)
- **Sorting Options**: Users can sort search results by factors such as:
  - Price (Low to High, High to Low)
  - Rating (Highest to Lowest)
  - Distance (Closest first)
- **Filtering Options**: Users can filter results by specific attributes, including:
  - Non-stop flights
  - Hotel amenities (e.g., pool, WiFi, parking)
  - Vehicle types (e.g., compact, luxury, SUV)
  
## How it Works
1. **User Input**: The user enters their desired search criteria (location, dates, budget, etc.) into the search form.
2. **Search Execution**: Once the user clicks the "Search" button, the system processes the input and queries the database or third-party APIs (e.g., for flights, hotels).
3. **Results Display**: The system presents a list of results based on the search criteria. These results are:
   - **Sorted** based on the selected sorting option.
   - **Filtered** based on any active filters.
4. **No Results Found**: If no results match the search criteria, the system shows a "No results found" message with suggestions, such as altering the search criteria or checking back later.
5. **Advanced Features**:
   - **Real-time suggestions**: Based on the search inputs, the system can suggest alternatives, such as nearby locations or different date ranges.
   - **Dynamic Filtering**: When the search results are shown, filters can dynamically update to match available data.

## Testing Search Functionality
When testing the Search Functionality, various scenarios must be checked to ensure its robustness:

### Scenarios to Test
- **Basic Search Tests**: Verify search functionality with valid inputs (location, dates, budget) and check for correct results.
- **No Results Found**: Test for conditions where no results match the search criteria. Verify that the system shows an appropriate message like "No results found" and suggests possible next steps.
- **Sorting Tests**: Validate sorting options (price, rating, distance) to ensure that results are ordered correctly.
- **Filtering Tests**: Test all available filters (e.g., amenities, vehicle types) and ensure results are filtered as per the user's selection.
- **Advanced Search Tests**: Test edge cases like searching for flights with overlapping dates or unavailable services due to external constraints (e.g., closed dates).
- **Performance Test**: Ensure the system can handle large datasets and provide search results without delays.
  
### Example Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: Searching for hotels in "New York" with a budget between $100-$200 per night, checking availability for "2024-12-01" to "2024-12-07". Verify that the system returns hotels within this price range.
- **Test Case 2**: Searching for a flight from "Los Angeles" to "London" on "2024-11-10". Sort results by **price (Low to High)**. Ensure that the results are sorted correctly.
- **Test Case 3**: Apply a filter for **non-smoking hotels** in a city with a high number of available hotels, and verify that only non-smoking hotels are listed.
- **Test Case 4**: Test search functionality for flights with no available seats on the selected date. The system should display the "No results found" message with options to change the date or search nearby dates.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Angular (or any other relevant framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Django (or any backend technology used)
- **Database/Integration**: MySQL, MongoDB, API integrations (for live flight, hotel, or car rental data)
- **Third-party APIs**: Travel or ecommerce APIs for product availability, payment processing, etc.
